Tournament system meant to be easy to use. Casa Familia Padel Club is written in async Python (with
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as frontend using the
[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library.

It has the following features:
- Supports **single elimination, round-robin and swiss** formats.
- **Build your tournament structure** with multiple stages that can have multiple groups/brackets in
  them.
- **Drag-and-drop matches** to different courts or reschedule them to another start time.
- Various **dashboard pages** are available that can be presented to the public, customized with a
  logo.
- Create/update **teams**, and add players to **teams**.
- Create **multiple clubs**, with **multiple tournaments** per club.
- **Swiss tournaments** can be handled dynamically, with automatic scheduling of matches.

# Quickstart
To quickly run bracket to see how it works, clone it and run `docker compose up`:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:evroon/bracket.git
cd bracket
sudo docker compose up -d
```

This will start the backend and frontend of Casa Familia Padel Club, as well as a postgres instance. You should now
be able to view bracket at http://localhost:3000. You can log in with the following credentials:

- Username: `test@example.org`
- Password: `aeGhoe1ahng2Aezai0Dei6Aih6dieHoo`.

To insert dummy rows into the database, run:
```bash
docker exec bracket-backend uv run --no-dev ./cli.py create-dev-db
```
